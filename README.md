## Course Description

<p>Ajax is a building block of the modern web. Ajax helps you communicate between your app and the server, and incorporate new content without reloading webpagesâ€”resulting in more interactive and high-performance apps. This course introduces both modern and legacy approaches for requesting and handling data and modifying webpage content with Ajax and vanilla JavaScript. JS expert Sasha Vodnik shows how to work with the Fetch APIs, so you can see how Ajax is implemented across a codebase. Along the way, learn how to optimize Ajax requests and responses within the browser, modify webpage content through the DOM, work with Axios library, and troubleshoot Ajax requests as they arise.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time-all while using a tool that you'll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the "Using GitHub Codespaces with this course" video to learn how to get started.</p>
